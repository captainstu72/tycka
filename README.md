Not much to say yet, but remember that the live receiver is not what is in this repo. To be able to be used by ChromeCast it is stored on Google Drive.

Dependencies
============

Right now this project is a modified copy of the CastHelloText-android (https://github.com/googlecast/CastHelloText-android).

As such, the dependencies are the same.

* The Android SDK android-support-v7-appcompat and android-support-v7-mediarouter support libraries (at least revision 19).
* The Android SDK google-play-services_lib library (at least version 4.2)
